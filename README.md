# TE_IT_OS_ASSIGNMENTS_SPPU
314446 : Operating Systems Lab | SPPU 2019 Pattern

# Assignment No. 1 :
A. Study of Basic Linux Commands: echo, ls, read, cat, touch, test, loops, arithmetic comparison,
conditional loops, grep,sed etc.

B. Write a program to implement an address book with options given below: a) Create address
book. b) View address book. c) Insert a record. d) Delete a record. e) Modify a record. f) Exit

# Assignment No. 2:
Process control system calls: The demonstration of FORK, EXECVE and WAIT system calls along with zombie and orphan states.<br>
A. Implement the C program in which main program accepts the integers to be sorted. Main program
usesthe FORK system call to create a new process called a child process. Parent process sortsthe integers
using sorting algorithm and waits for child process using WAIT system call to sort the integers using any
sorting algorithm. Also demonstrate zombie and orphan states.

B. Implement the C program in which main program accepts an array. Main program uses the FORK
system call to create a new process called a child process. Parent process sorts an array and passes the
sorted array to child process through the command line arguments of EXECVE system call. The child
process uses EXECVE system callto load new program which display array in reverse order.

# Assignment No. 3:
Implement the C program for CPU Scheduling Algorithms: Shortest Job First
(Preemptive) and Round Robin with different arrival time.

# Assignment No. 4:
A. Thread synchronization using counting semaphores. Application to demonstrate: producerconsumer problem with counting semaphores and mutex.

B. Thread synchronization and mutual exclusion using mutex. Application to demonstrate: ReaderWriter problem with reader priority.

# Assignment No. 5:
Implement the C program forDeadlock Avoidance Algorithm: Bankers Algorithm.
# Assignment No. 6:
Implement the C program for Page Replacement Algorithms: FCFS, LRU, andOptimal for frame size as
minimum three.
# Assignment No. 7:
Inter process communication in Linux using following.<br>
A. FIFOS: Full duplex communication between two independent processes. First process accepts
sentences and writes on one pipe to be read by second process and second process counts number of
characters, number of words and number of lines in accepted sentences, writes this output in a text file
and writes the contents of the file on second pipe to be read by first process and displays on standard
output.

B. Inter-process Communication using Shared Memory using System V. Application to demonstrate:
Client and Server Programs in which server process creates a shared memory segment and writes the
message to the shared memory segment. Client process reads the message from the shared memory
segment and displays it to the screen.

# Assignment No. 8: 
Implement the C program for Disk Scheduling Algorithms: SSTF, SCAN, C-Look
considering the initial head position moving away from the spindle.
